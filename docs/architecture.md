# SIEM Architecture Documentation

## System Architecture Overview

The SIEM solution is built on a microservices architecture, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and resilience.

### Core Components

1. **Data Collection Layer**
   - Distributed agents for log collection
   - Support for syslog, Windows events, application logs
   - Real-time streaming using Apache Kafka
   - Custom protocols for IoT device integration

2. **Processing Layer**
   - Event normalization and enrichment
   - Real-time correlation engine
   - Machine learning pipeline for anomaly detection
   - Threat intelligence integration

3. **Storage Layer**
   - Hot storage: Elasticsearch for recent events
   - Cold storage: Object storage for historical data
   - Redis for caching and real-time analytics
   - PostgreSQL for configuration and metadata

4. **Analysis Layer**
   - Real-time threat detection
   - Behavioral analysis
   - Pattern matching engine
   - ML-based anomaly detection
   - MITRE ATT&CK framework integration

5. **Response Layer**
   - Automated incident response
   - Playbook execution engine
   - Integration with security tools
   - Alert management system

6. **Presentation Layer**
   - Web-based dashboard
   - RESTful API
   - Real-time monitoring
   - Custom reporting engine

### Data Flow

```
[Data Sources] → [Collectors] → [Processing Pipeline] → [Storage]
                                       ↓
                               [Analysis Engine]
                                       ↓
                             [Response Automation]
                                       ↓
                               [Dashboard/API]
```

### Security Measures

1. **Data Security**
   - End-to-end encryption
   - Data anonymization
   - Access control
   - Audit logging

2. **System Security**
   - Role-based access control
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - API security
   - Network isolation

### Scalability

- Horizontal scaling of collectors
- Distributed processing
- Load balancing
- Auto-scaling capabilities

### High Availability

- Active-active configuration
- Automatic failover
- Data replication
- Disaster recovery
